# T1D_treg_splicing
Scripts and programs pertaining to the analysis of differential splicing of genes expressed  in memory CD4+/CD25+ regulatory T-cells and memory CD4+/CD25- T-cells from type 1 diabetics and controls. These are presented here for the purposes of code deposition and availability for manuscript submission and are actively been updated and maintained as of 2022/08/09

## Organizational notes (2022/08/09):
- move/mirror to Concannon lab repo
- update pre-2021 code to latest lab conventions for consistency
- "build project"-style script that downloads all relevant external references not hosted in this repo to aid in replication
- rename relevant bash scripts to format ##_Description.[sh/sbatch] to indicate order of execution at a glance
- modify hardcoded paths to relative paths and/or environmental variables for easier replication
- deposition of Event Analysis annotations (these may be deposited off-site due to file size constraints)
